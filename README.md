# Z80-Multicore

This repository is the research and results of trying to turn two Z80 into a single two core CPU, without dual-port RAM.

## Goal

In short, the goal of this project was to learn how to make two basic CPUs multitask in a seamless manner.

Here is a more detailed descriptions of my goals:
- Learn to read datasheets effectively;
- Learn about older 8-bit MPU as a foundation;
- Learn about simple multitasking on the CPU level;
- Learn more detailled assembly-style programming;
- Practice circuit design to achieve a desired goal;
- Have fun making the circuit itself!

Although there seems to be very serious learning involved, I want to make it clear that this is being done as a hobby and I do not imply that I am necessarily doing anything the right way, or that I am an expert.

## Research

Here is a list of ressources I have used to do my research on this subject:
- Z80 [Datasheet](https://www.mouser.ca/datasheet/2/450/ps0178-19386.pdf) from Mouser
- Ben Eater's breadboard 6502 computer [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnzuMJLZRdU&list=PLowKtXNTBypFbtuVMUVXNR0z1mu7dp7eH)

Here is a list of ressources I have referenced when doing research, but did not fully read:
- The Art of Electronics by Paul Horowitz and Winfield Hill
- Digital Computer Electronics by Albert Paul Malvino
- Z80 CPU User Manual [[pdf](http://www.zilog.com/docs/z80/um0080.pdf)]

Although I did not fully read them, I still believe them to be really good ressources and should be read thoroughly for an even better experience and knowledge base.
