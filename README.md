# Z80-Multicore

This repository is the research and results of trying to turn two Z80 into a single two core CPU

## Goal

In short, the goal of this project was to learn how to make two basic CPUs multitask in a seamless manner.

Here is a more detailed descriptions of my goals:
- Learn to read datasheets effectively;
- Learn about older 8-bit MPU as a foundation;
- Learn about simple multitasking on the CPU level;
- Learn more detailled assembly-style programming;
- Practice circuit design to achieve a desired goal;
- Have fun making the circuit itself!

Although there seems to be very serious learning involved, I want to make it clear that this is being done as a hobby and I do not imply that I am necessarily doing anything the right way, or that I am an expert.


## Research

Here is a list of ressources I have used to do my research on this subject:
